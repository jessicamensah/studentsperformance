Building a Student Performance Classifier using Python: Tkinter Module & MongoDB Security

Undoubtedly, the education system exerts a significant influence on the youth of today. Whilst job competition increases, many students take into consideration the amount of time and resources they may put towards increasing their skills. However, other factors affect a student’s performance such as their parent’s level of education, their ability to afford lunch, if they have done an extra test preparation course, and their race/ethnicity.

The following will outline the variables that could affect a Student’s Performance. “For every 10 free school meal students and 10 students not on the meals, on average students who are not on free school meals have achieved one grade better than the free school meals pupils compared to previous years”. Statistics such as the above were able to formulate an argument that would portray results in the finalized program whereas, if all other variables were in place, the program would give an output of the students' score due to a pupil’s circumstances.
